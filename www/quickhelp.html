<p>
	There are several non-button elements in the UI that perform an action when tapped.
</p>
<div id="quickhelp-active-elements">
	<ul>
		<li><span> Instant Play</span>
			<p>Tapping on the cover in Radio or Album views instantly plays the item by performing either a Clear/Play or Add/Play depending on the Instant play action setting in Library options. If the setting is Add/Play and the item is currently in the Playlist then it is played directly rather than adding a new duplicate item. There is also an option for No action.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Renderer Active screens</span>
			<p>Tapping on the title in the center of Bluetooth, Analog Input or S/PDIF Input Active will launch their respective Config screens which allow the input/output settings to be changed.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Time knob</span>
			<p>Tapping on the time while a song file is playing will toggle between counting the time up or down. Tapping or dragging the time ring moves forward or backward in the song.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Volume knob</span>
			<p>Tapping on the numeric volume level toggles the mute state. Tapping ahead on the volume ring advances the volume by a maximum number of steps called the Volume step limit. This limit can be set via Audio Config. Tapping the plus/minus buttons adjusts volume by 1 step.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Song title</span>
			<p>Tapping the song title underneath the cover art in Playback launches a Google search in a separate Browser tab. On Smartphones it scrolls the Playlist to that item.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Radio station or Artist - Album</span>
			<p>Tapping the Radio station name or the Artist - Album title underneath the cover art in Playback switches to Playbar in Radio or Tag view respectively. In tag view the artist filter is applied. In radio view the list is scrolled to the station.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Swipe gestures</span>
			<p>On Smartphones swiping up scrolls the Playlist into view and tapping on the Playbar cover returns to Playback. In the Library tag view swiping sideways shows/hides the Genres column.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
